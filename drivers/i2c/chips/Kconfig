config TWL4030_MADC
	tristate "TWL4030 MADC Driver"
	depends on TWL4030_CORE
	help
	The TWL4030 Monitoring ADC driver enables the host
	processor to monitor analog signals using analog-to-digital
	conversions on the input source. TWL4030 MADC provides the
	following features:
	 - Single 10-bit ADC with successive approximation register (SAR) conversion;
	 - Analog multiplexer for 16 inputs;
	 - Seven (of the 16) inputs are freely available;
	 - Battery voltage monitoring;
	 - Concurrent conversion request management;
	 - Interrupt signal to Primary Interrupt Handler;
	 - Averaging feature;
	 - Selective enable/disable of the averaging feature.

	Say 'y' here to statically link this module into the kernel or 'm'
	to build it as a dinamically loadable module. The module will be
	called twl4030-madc.ko
